# @reallyuseful/logger

**A simple and extensible logging system for Node.js.**

üë∑ _Under development_

```javascript
const { Logger } = require('@reallyuseful/logger');
const myLogger = new Logger();
myLogger.info('üåç Hello, world!');
myLogger.err('üí• An error occurred.', { context: 42 });
```

## Logging to external services

You can log to multiple services at once.

- The console: [`ConsoleTransport`](#options-for-the-consoletransport)
- AWS CloudWatch Logs
- Sentry.io
- syslog and Papertrail.io via rsyslog
- Graylog/GELF
- Any other service: [adding a new `Transport` is easy](#add-your-own-logging-service)

## Promises

Each logging function returns a `Promise` that is resolved once all the transports have finished logging.

## Usage

```javascript
const logger = new Logger([array of Transports]);
```

- If you don‚Äôt provide any transports, you‚Äôll get a `ConsoleTransport`.
- Logging functions are named after the [syslog severity levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog#Severity_level). Here they are, from least- to most-severe:

```javascript
logger.debug(‚Ä¶);
logger.info(‚Ä¶);
logger.notice(‚Ä¶);
logger.warning(‚Ä¶);
logger.err(‚Ä¶);
logger.crit(‚Ä¶);
logger.alert(‚Ä¶);
logger.emerg(‚Ä¶);
```

You can pass anything as arguments to these functions. It‚Äôs common to pass a string as the first argument, followed by additional objects that you want to log. (Just like `console.log`.)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
logger.info(
  'This is a string',
  { extraInfo: 42 },
  [ 'Gryffindor', 'Hufflepuff', 'Ravenclaw', 'Slytherin' ]
);
```

## Options for the ConsoleTransport

ConsoleTransport can be customized with any of the following options:

- **level** (Level): Don‚Äôt log anything below this severity level. Default: log everything
- **color** (boolean): If `true`, console output is colorized. Default: `true`
- **timestamps** (boolean): If `true`, console output is prefixed with the current timestamp. Default: `true`
- **prefix** (string): If provided, prefix each log message‚Äôs details with this string.

```javascript
const transport = new ConsoleTransport({ <options> });
const logger = new Logger(transport);
```

## Add your own logging service

To log to a service that isn‚Äôt listed above, you can add support by creating a `Transport`.

A `Transport` is any object with the following properties:

- A `log()` method.
- A `level` property (optional).

### log(level, ...details)

The `log` method takes a severity level as its first argument. Additional arguments are the details to be logged.

The `log` method returns a `Promise`, and you should not resolve it until logging is complete. For example, if you are logging to a file, don‚Äôt resolve the `Promise` until the message has been written to disk.

### level _optional property_

If your transport object has a `level` property, this is the _minimum_ severity to be logged. For example if your object has a `level` property that is set to `Level.warning`, then your transport will receive log messages for `warning`, `err`, `crit`, `alert` and `emerg`, but not for `debug`, `info` or `notice`.

```javascript
const verySimpleTransport = {
  level: Level.warning,
  log: (level, ...details) => {
    console.log(`${Level[level]} - `, ...details);
    return Promise.resolve();
  }
};
```
